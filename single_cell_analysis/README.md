# Single Cell Analysis of HGG patients 

Here, we analyzed our scRNA-seq data as well as Darmanis _et al._'s scRNA-seq dataset ([GSE84465](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE84465)) to investigate cellular heterogeneity in HGG patients. Furthermore, the analyzed datasets are utilized to quantify the cellular rate of metabolic reactions from the metabolic gene expressions in various cell types.
